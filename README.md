### ram_check

- `tactical.io.size_ram_check(filename)`: checks if file is small enough to be loaded into memory without causing swapping
  - `filename` is a string
  - returns nothing; requires user input to proceed if file is too large

## Bash

### mktikz

Compiles a set of .tikz files into .pdf figures. Usage:
``` bash
./mkfig.sh files output_directory width height
```
where:
- _files_ is a regular expression indicating one or more .tikz files
- _output_directory_ is the directory in which pdf files will be generated
- _width_ is the width of the figure, relative to `\linewidth`
- _height_ is the height of the figure, relative to `\linewidth`

Notice that the value of `\linewidth` used is the one for the standard book class.
This should work well in most cases.

For best results, when including the .pdf figures in your Latex document use the same _width_ as the one here specified.
In this way, text size will be the same in all figures.

NOTICE: this script works correctly if input .tikz files do not have width and height specifications.
This is usually the case for a file generated by pgfplotlib.
